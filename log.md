### Day 2: Jan. 2, 2020

**Today's Progress**: 
Continued on with the youtube video of learning how to configure Visual Studio Code for basic development setup.  I did my first updates to this log.md in Visual Studio and was able to commit it to github. When I am done with this tutorial, I am going to take one on Github / Markdown, as it is totally new for me.
