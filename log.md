### Day 2: Jan. 2, 2020

**Today's Progress**: 
Continued on with the youtube video of learning how to configure Visual Studio Code for basic development setup.  I did my first updates to this log.md in Visual Studio and was able to commit it to github. When I am done with this tutorial, I am going to take one on Github / Markdown, as it is totally new for me.

### Day 3: Jan. 3, 2020

**Today's Progress**: 
Continued on with the youtube video of learning how to configure Visual Studio Code for development setup. 

Learned a little bit about using virtual environments or VENV, which I will have to check out his video on. [Python Tutorial: VENV (Windows) - How to Use Virtual Environments with the Built-In venv Module](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=APOPm01BVrk)

Code formating is going to be handy as well as Code Runner.

### Day 4: Jan. 4, 2020

**Today's Progress**: 
Actually worked on trying to figure out markdown syntax. I found a little [Cheat Sheet](https://guides.github.com/pdfs/markdown-cheatsheet-online.pdf), plus the official [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/). I still need to rap my head around this.  I kind of see why they didn't follow html format, as you have to close the statement, however, it still takes time to get used to.

### Day 5: Jan. 5, 2020

**Today's Progress**: 
Continued on with the youtube video of learning how to configure Visual Studio Code for development setup.  I love the feature for debugging a script. You can create break points. What I like about this, is you can drill down, on the left hand side, to all the variables. I have been looking for something like this to be able to start on the python script I want to make to scrap a webpage on a daily basis. I hope to start working on it soon and publish it.  I like the [requests library](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/).
